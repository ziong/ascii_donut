/* This file can be used for global styles if preferred over app.vue <style> */
/* For this project, the global styles are simple enough to be in app.vue */
/* If we had more extensive global styling, this would be the place. */

/* Example:
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #000;
  color: #00ff00;
  font-family: monospace;
  overflow: hidden;
}
*/

/* We have already placed these styles in app.vue's <style> tag.
   If nuxt.config.ts points to this file via `css: ['~/assets/main.css']`,
   then styles here would also be applied. It's generally better to have them in one place.
   For now, leaving this file minimal as app.vue handles the necessary global styles.
